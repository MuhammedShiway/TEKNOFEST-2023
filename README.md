# TEKNOFEST AI in Healthcare Challenge (2023) - README

## üåü Introduction
Welcome to our TEKNOFEST AI in Healthcare Challenge project! Here, we focus on improving mammography image classification for early detection of breast cancer. Our work is detailed in the report at: [DOI 10.13140/RG.2.2.25707.11049](http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.25707.11049).

## üéØ What We Accomplished
- **Task Overview**: Classification of mammography images in three key areas:
  - **BIRADS Classification**
  - **Breast Composition Classification**
  - **Lesion Location Classification**

## üí° Our Approach
- **Innovative Image Processing**:
  - Adaptive cropping and conversion of DICOM to PNG.
  - Dynamic pixel normalization for diverse pixel values.
- **Adaptive Techniques**:
  - Resolution adjustment.
  - Image inversion management based on mean pixel values.
- **Focus Enhancement**:
  - Binarization and cropping to isolate the breast area.

## üöÄ Key Innovations
- **Differential Convolution (DiffConv)**:
  - [Link to DiffConv Article](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neunet.2019.04.025)
  - Enhanced classification performance.
- **EfficientNet Models**:
  - **Improved EfficientNetB0**: 67% accuracy in BIRADS classification.
  - **Improved EfficientNetV2S**: 77.1% accuracy in Breast Composition classification.

## üéóÔ∏è Conclusion
Our project provides a robust framework for mammographic image classification, aiming to improve early breast cancer detection and diagnosis.
